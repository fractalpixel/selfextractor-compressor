selfextractor-compressor
========================

A tool for turning a javascript file into a shorter block of javascript code that unpacks and runs 
the original code.  Geared towards demoscene use and packing small javascript files targeting a few
kilobytes to tens of kilobytes.  Not intended or tested for larger websites or web applications 
(the compression time grows exponentially with the input size).

Usage
=====

    selfextractor-compressor [options]

    Example:  selfextractor-compressor  -i input.js  -o compressed-output.js

    Options:
    -V, --version     Output the version number.
    -i, --in <file>   Javascript file to compress.
    -o, --out <file>  File to save output to.  Existing content will be overwritten.
    -h, --help        Display help for command.


Notes
=====

If the input file could not be compressed smaller than its original size, the original input file is 
returned instead, and a note printed to the console.

The compressor requires at least a few unused ascii characters, that can be used as separators in
the self extraction datablock.  It will warn if there is none, and return the source unmodified.

The compressor doesn't unfortunately currently handle files that contain backticks with variable
references inside (`foo $VarName bar`), as they conflict with the unpacking code.  It will warn 
about them, and return the source unmodified.
